# gptdd ðŸ§ª

_A single-file, test-driven-development feedback loop with GPT ðŸŒ€_

## How it Works

Given command which runs a test and a file to edit , `gptdd` feeds the test results to GPT4, requests a fix, and offers the user the option to apply the fix.

> ðŸ’­ It would be amazing to build this in at the test runner/IDE-level, but in the interest of it being language and test-runner agnostic, it's a standalone script. If you're interested in building an IDE plugin, please reach out!

## Usage

```bash
npx gptdd \
  --testToRun "pnpm vitest run examples/myFunc.test.ts" \
  --fileToFix "examples/myFunc.ts" \
  --apiKey "sk-..." \
  --watchFiles "examples/myFunc*"
```

### Specific Examples

The following examples specific to your language/test-runner. If you don't see what you're looking for, please contribute!

#### Javascript - Vitest

```bash
npx gptdd \
  --testToRun "vitest run examples/myFunc.test.ts" \
  --fileToFix "examples/myFunc.ts" \
  --apiKey sk-555555"
```

#### Javascript - Jest

```bash
npx gptdd \
  --testToRun "jest examples/myFunc.test.ts" \
  --fileToFix "examples/myFunc.ts" \
  --apiKey sk-555555"
```

## Development

We recommend using `pnpm`. Clone the repository, run `pnpm install`. Then run `pnpm link --global` to make the `gptdd` command available globally. From there, you can make tweaks and test them out by running `gptdd` in a directory with a test and file to fix.
